# Hands-on core.logic

These are my notes and further material for my [Hands-on logic programming with core.logic](http://fpdays.net/fpdays2013/sessions/index.php?session=19) session at [FP Days 2013](http://fpdays.net/fpdays2013/). A part from the teaching script found in `src/`, this repository contains

- `src/lecture_notes.clj`: lecture notes concerning finite domains
- `homework.md`: some optional homework
- `where_to_go_now.md`: material for further study

## Having a go with the material from the session

Start a repl and start copying things in from src/hands_on.clj

    lein repl

Alternatively, start a nREPL session in Emacs.

## Setting up a session for several people

At the session, I used Hajime to allow people to start coding without having to set up Clojure on their local machine. My modified version of Hajime can be found [here](https://github.com/tgk/hajime).
